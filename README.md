## Objective

X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. Many professionals visit their website daily, often through marketing on various websites and search engines like Google. They may browse courses, fill out forms, or watch videos. When they fill out forms with their email or phone number, they become leads. Leads also come from past referrals.

The sales team contacts these leads through calls and emails, but only about 30% convert. To improve efficiency, X Education wants to identify 'Hot Leads'â€”those most likely to convert.

### Approach:
* Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. A higher score indicates a higher likelihood of conversion.
* This model will help the sales team focus on the most promising leads, improving the conversion rate.
* The model should be adaptable to future changes in requirements, as outlined in a separate document.

### Deliverables:
* Develop and refine the logistic regression model.
* Use the model to predict lead scores.
* Fill out the additional requirements document based on the model.
* Include these insights and recommendations in the final presentation.
